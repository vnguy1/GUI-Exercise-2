# GUI-Exercise-2
[Level 2] Create a SIMPLE calculation type program in a windows environment, such as a conversion calculator, algebra problem or even a bank account update based on withdrawals or deposits, etc. It should be ONE window that takes (a) number(s) a user types in (text field), and when a button is clicked displays a result on the window (label). Make sure you use exception handling for the numbers entered, so the program doesnâ€™t produce errors and/or unhandled exceptions even in the background.
